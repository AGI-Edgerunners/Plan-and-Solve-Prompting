    "text": "the following table shows the impact of catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums and the impact of prior period development on our consolidated loss and loss expense ratio for the periods indicated. . we recorded net pre-tax catastrophe losses of $ 366 million in 2010 compared with net pre-tax catastrophe losses of $ 137 million and $ 567 million in 2009 and 2008 , respectively . the catastrophe losses for 2010 were primarily related to weather- related events in the u.s. , earthquakes in chile , mexico , and new zealand , and storms in australia and europe . the catastrophe losses for 2009 were primarily related to an earthquake in asia , floods in europe , several weather-related events in the u.s. , and a european windstorm . for 2008 , the catastrophe losses were primarily related to hurricanes gustav and ike . prior period development arises from changes to loss estimates recognized in the current year that relate to loss reserves first reported in previous calendar years and excludes the effect of losses from the development of earned premium from pre- vious accident years . we experienced $ 503 million of net favorable prior period development in our p&c segments in 2010 . this compares with net favorable prior period development in our p&c segments of $ 576 million and $ 814 million in 2009 and 2008 , respectively . refer to 201cprior period development 201d for more information . the adjusted loss and loss expense ratio declined in 2010 , compared with 2009 , primarily due to the impact of the crop settlements , non-recurring premium adjustment and the reduction in assumed loss portfolio business , which is written at higher loss ratios than other types of business . our policy acquisition costs include commissions , premium taxes , underwriting , and other costs that vary with , and are primarily related to , the production of premium . administrative expenses include all other operating costs . our policy acquis- ition cost ratio increased in 2010 , compared with 2009 . the increase was primarily related to the impact of crop settlements , which generated higher profit-share commissions and a lower adjustment to net premiums earned , as well as the impact of reinstatement premiums expensed in connection with catastrophe activity and changes in business mix . our administrative expense ratio increased in 2010 , primarily due to the impact of the crop settlements , reinstatement premiums expensed , and increased costs in our international operations . although the crop settlements generate minimal administrative expenses , they resulted in lower adjustment to net premiums earned in 2010 , compared with 2009 . administrative expenses in 2010 , were partially offset by higher net results generated by our third party claims administration business , esis , the results of which are included within our administrative expenses . esis generated $ 85 million in net results in 2010 , compared with $ 26 million in 2009 . the increase is primarily from non-recurring sources . our policy acquisition cost ratio was stable in 2009 , compared with 2008 , as increases in our combined insurance operations were offset by more favorable final crop year settlement of profit share commissions . administrative expenses increased in 2009 , primarily due to the inclusion of administrative expenses related to combined insurance for the full year and costs associated with new product expansion in our domestic retail operation and in our personal lines business . our effective income tax rate , which we calculate as income tax expense divided by income before income tax , is depend- ent upon the mix of earnings from different jurisdictions with various tax rates . a change in the geographic mix of earnings would change the effective income tax rate . our effective income tax rate was 15 percent in 2010 , compared with 17 percent and 24 percent in 2009 and 2008 , respectively . the decrease in our effective income tax rate in 2010 , was primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings to lower tax-paying jurisdictions , a decrease in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits which was the result of a settlement with the u.s . internal revenue service appeals division regarding federal tax returns for the years 2002-2004 , and the recognition of a non-taxable gain related to the acquisition of rain and hail . the 2009 year included a reduction of a deferred tax valuation allowance related to investments . for 2008 , our effective income tax rate was adversely impacted by a change in mix of earnings due to the impact of catastrophe losses in lower tax-paying jurisdictions . prior period development the favorable prior period development , inclusive of the life segment , of $ 512 million during 2010 was the net result of sev- eral underlying favorable and adverse movements . with respect to ace 2019s crop business , ace regularly receives reports from its

primarily was attributable to an improvement in our operating working capital balances of $ 570 million as discussed below , and $ 187 million related to lower net income tax payments , as compared to 2009 . partially offsetting these improvements was a net reduction in cash from operations of $ 350 million related to our defined benefit pension plan . this reduction was the result of increased contributions to the pension trust of $ 758 million as compared to 2009 , partially offset by an increase in the cas costs recovered on our contracts . operating working capital accounts consists of receivables , inventories , accounts payable , and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred . the improvement in cash provided by operating working capital was due to a decline in 2010 accounts receivable balances compared to 2009 , and an increase in 2010 customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred balances compared to 2009 . these improvements partially were offset by a decline in accounts payable balances in 2010 compared to 2009 . the decline in accounts receivable primarily was due to higher collections on various programs at electronic systems , is&gs , and space systems business areas . the increase in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred primarily was attributable to an increase on government and commercial satellite programs at space systems and air mobility programs at aeronautics , partially offset by a decrease on various programs at electronic systems . the decrease in accounts payable was attributable to the timing of accounts payable activities across all segments . net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $ 1248 million to $ 3173 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 . the decline primarily was attributable to an increase in our contributions to the defined benefit pension plan of $ 1373 million as compared to 2008 and an increase in our operating working capital accounts of $ 147 million . partially offsetting these items was the impact of lower net income tax payments in 2009 as compared to 2008 in the amount of $ 319 million . the decline in cash provided by operating working capital primarily was due to growth of receivables on various programs in the ms2 and gt&l lines of business at electronic systems and an increase in inventories on combat aircraft programs at aeronautics , which partially were offset by increases in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred on government satellite programs at space systems and the timing of accounts payable activities .

    "text": "jpmorgan chase & co . / 2007 annual report 31 the following section provides a comparative discussion of jpmorgan chase 2019s consolidated results of operations on a reported basis for the three-year period ended december 31 , 2007 . factors that relate primarily to a single business segment are discussed in more detail within that business segment than they are in this consolidated sec- tion . for a discussion of the critical accounting estimates used by the firm that affect the consolidated results of operations , see pages 96 201398 of this annual report . 2007 compared with 2006 total net revenue of $ 71.4 billion was up $ 9.4 billion , or 15% ( 15 % ) , from the prior year . higher net interest income , very strong private equity gains , record asset management , administration and commissions revenue , higher mortgage fees and related income and record investment banking fees contributed to the revenue growth . these increases were offset partially by lower trading revenue . investment banking fees grew in 2007 to a level higher than the pre- vious record set in 2006 . record advisory and equity underwriting fees drove the results , partially offset by lower debt underwriting fees . for a further discussion of investment banking fees , which are primarily recorded in ib , see the ib segment results on pages 40 201342 of this annual report . principal transactions revenue consists of trading revenue and private equity gains . trading revenue declined significantly from the 2006 level , primarily due to markdowns in ib of $ 1.4 billion ( net of hedges ) on subprime positions , including subprime cdos , and $ 1.3 billion ( net of fees ) on leveraged lending funded loans and unfunded commitments . also in ib , markdowns in securitized products on nonsubprime mortgages and weak credit trading performance more than offset record revenue in currencies and strong revenue in both rates and equities . equities benefited from strong client activity and record trading results across all products . ib 2019s credit portfolio results increased compared with the prior year , primarily driven by higher revenue from risk management activities . the increase in private equity gains from 2006 reflected a significantly higher level of gains , the classification of certain private equity carried interest as compensation expense and a fair value adjustment in the first quarter of 2007 on nonpublic private equity investments resulting from the adoption of sfas 157 ( 201cfair value measurements 201d ) . for a further discussion of principal transactions revenue , see the ib and corporate segment results on pages 40 201342 and 59 201360 , respectively , and note 6 on page 122 of this annual report . lending & deposit-related fees rose from the 2006 level , driven pri- marily by higher deposit-related fees and the bank of new york transaction . for a further discussion of lending & deposit-related fees , which are mostly recorded in rfs , tss and cb , see the rfs segment results on pages 43 201348 , the tss segment results on pages 54 201355 , and the cb segment results on pages 52 201353 of this annual report . asset management , administration and commissions revenue reached a level higher than the previous record set in 2006 . increased assets under management and higher performance and placement fees in am drove the record results . the 18% ( 18 % ) growth in assets under management from year-end 2006 came from net asset inflows and market appreciation across all segments : institutional , retail , private bank and private client services . tss also contributed to the rise in asset management , administration and commissions revenue , driven by increased product usage by new and existing clients and market appreciation on assets under custody . finally , commissions revenue increased , due mainly to higher brokerage transaction volume ( primarily included within fixed income and equity markets revenue of ib ) , which more than offset the sale of the insurance business by rfs in the third quarter of 2006 and a charge in the first quarter of 2007 resulting from accelerated surrenders of customer annuities . for additional information on these fees and commissions , see the segment discussions for ib on pages 40 201342 , rfs on pages 43 201348 , tss on pages 54 201355 , and am on pages 56 201358 , of this annual report . the favorable variance resulting from securities gains in 2007 compared with securities losses in 2006 was primarily driven by improvements in the results of repositioning of the treasury invest- ment securities portfolio . also contributing to the positive variance was a $ 234 million gain from the sale of mastercard shares . for a fur- ther discussion of securities gains ( losses ) , which are mostly recorded in the firm 2019s treasury business , see the corporate segment discussion on pages 59 201360 of this annual report . consol idated results of operat ions .",

    "text": "the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee . the following is a discussion of the more significant assumptions , estimates , accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements : 2022 revenue recognition - we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists , delivery of product has occurred , the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured . for our company , this means that revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss is transferred to our customers . title transfers to our customers upon shipment or upon receipt at the customer's location as determined by the sales terms for each transaction . the company estimates the cost of sales returns based on historical experience , and these estimates are normally immaterial . 2022 goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets valuation - we test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review . we perform our annual impairment analysis in the first quarter of each year . while the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment for both goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists , the company elects to perform the quantitative assessment for our annual impairment analysis . the impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or non-amortizable intangible asset to the carrying value . if the carrying value exceeds the fair value , goodwill or a non-amortizable intangible asset is considered impaired . to determine the fair value of goodwill , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model , supported by the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global and local companies within the tobacco industry . at december 31 , 2015 , the carrying value of our goodwill was $ 7.4 billion , which is related to ten reporting units , each of which is comprised of a group of markets with similar economic characteristics . the estimated fair value of our ten reporting units exceeded the carrying value as of december 31 , 2015 . to determine the fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relief-from-royalty method . we concluded that the fair value of our non-amortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value , and any reasonable movement in the assumptions would not result in an impairment . these discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for forecasting operating cash flows , which are subject to changes in business conditions , such as volumes and prices , costs to produce , discount rates and estimated capital needs . management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated , and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use . since the march 28 , 2008 , spin-off from altria , we have not recorded a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or non-amortizable intangible assets . 2022 marketing and advertising costs - we incur certain costs to support our products through programs which include advertising , marketing , consumer engagement and trade promotions . the costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with u.s . recognition of the cost related to our consumer engagement and trade promotion programs contain uncertainties due to the judgment required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program . for volume-based incentives provided to customers , management continually assesses and estimates , by customer , the likelihood of the customer achieving the specified targets and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made . for other trade promotions , management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience . changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position , results of operations or operating cash flows . we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate our marketing programs during the past three years . 2022 employee benefit plans - as discussed in item 8 , note 13 . benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements , we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees , including pensions , postretirement health care and postemployment benefits ( primarily severance ) . we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by u.s . these calculations include various actuarial assumptions , such as discount rates , assumed rates of return on plan assets , compensation increases , mortality , turnover rates and health care cost trend rates . we review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so . as permitted by u.s . gaap , any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods . we believe that the assumptions utilized in calculating our obligations under these plans are reasonable based upon our historical experience and advice from our actuaries . weighted-average discount rate assumptions for pensions and postretirement plans are as follows: . we anticipate that assumption changes , coupled with decreased amortization of deferred losses , will decrease 2016 pre-tax u.s . pension and postretirement expense to approximately $ 209 million as compared with approximately $ 240 million in 2015 , excluding .",

primarily was attributable to an improvement in our operating working capital balances of $ 570 million as discussed below , and $ 187 million related to lower net income tax payments , as compared to 2009 . partially offsetting these improvements was a net reduction in cash from operations of $ 350 million related to our defined benefit pension plan . this reduction was the result of increased

offset by a decline in accounts payable balances in 2010 compared to 2009 . the decline in accounts receivable primarily was due to higher collections on various programs at electronic systems , is&gs

of accounts payable activities across all segments . net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $ 1248 million to $ 3173 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 . the decline primarily was attributable to an increase in our contributions to the defined benefit pension plan of $ 1373 million as compared to 2008 and an increase in our operating working capital accounts of $ 147 million . partially offsetting these items was the impact of lower net income tax payments in 2009 as compared to 2008 in the amount of $ 319 million . the decline in cash provided by operating working capital primarily was due to growth of receivables on various programs in the ms2 and gt&l lines of business at electronic systems and an increase in inventories on combat aircraft programs at aeronautics , which partially were offset by increases in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred on government satellite programs at space systems and the timing of accounts payable activities .

    "text": "table of contents the estimated amortization expense at september 26 , 2015 for each of the five succeeding fiscal years was as follows: . goodwill in accordance with asc 350 , intangibles 2014goodwill and other ( asc 350 ) , the company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value . events that could indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include , but are not limited to , current economic and market conditions , including a decline in market capitalization , a significant adverse change in legal factors , business climate , operational performance of the business or key personnel , and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator . in performing the impairment test , the company utilizes the two-step approach prescribed under asc 350 . the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of each reporting unit to its estimated fair value . to estimate the fair value of its reporting units for step 1 , the company primarily utilizes the income approach . the income approach is based on a dcf analysis and calculates the fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting the after-tax cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate . assumptions used in the dcf require significant judgment , including judgment about appropriate discount rates and terminal values , growth rates , and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows . the forecasted cash flows are based on the company 2019s most recent budget and strategic plan and for years beyond this period , the company 2019s estimates are based on assumed growth rates expected as of the measurement date . the company believes its assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses . the discount rates used are intended to reflect the risks inherent in future cash flow projections and are based on estimates of the weighted-average cost of capital ( 201cwacc 201d ) of market participants relative to each respective reporting unit . the market approach considers comparable market data based on multiples of revenue or earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization ( 201cebitda 201d ) and is primarily used as a corroborative analysis to the results of the dcf analysis . the company believes its assumptions used to determine the fair value of its reporting units are reasonable . if different assumptions were used , particularly with respect to forecasted cash flows , terminal values , waccs , or market multiples , different estimates of fair value may result and there could be the potential that an impairment charge could result . actual operating results and the related cash flows of the reporting units could differ from the estimated operating results and related cash flows . if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value , the company is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss , if any . the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit 2019s goodwill to its carrying value . the implied fair value of goodwill is derived by performing a hypothetical purchase price allocation for each reporting unit as of the measurement date and allocating the reporting unit 2019s estimated fair value to its assets and liabilities . the residual amount from performing this allocation represents the implied fair value of goodwill . to the extent this amount is below the carrying value of goodwill , an impairment charge is recorded . the company conducted its fiscal 2015 impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter , and as noted above used dcf and market approaches to estimate the fair value of its reporting units as of june 28 , 2015 , and ultimately used the fair value determined by the dcf approach in making its impairment test conclusions . the company believes it used reasonable estimates and assumptions about future revenue , cost projections , cash flows , market multiples and discount rates as of the measurement date . as a result of completing step 1 , all of the company's reporting units had fair values exceeding their carrying values , and as such , step 2 of the impairment test was not required . for illustrative purposes , had the fair value of each of the reporting units that passed step 1 been lower than 10% ( 10 % ) , all of the reporting units would still have passed step 1 of the goodwill impairment test . at september 26 , 2015 , the company believes that each reporting unit , with goodwill aggregating 2.81 billion , was not at risk of failing step 1 of the goodwill impairment test based on the current forecasts . the company conducted its fiscal 2014 annual impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter , and as noted above used dcf and market approaches to estimate the fair value of its reporting units as of june 29 , 2014 , and ultimately used the fair value determined by the dcf approach in making its impairment test conclusions . the company believes it used reasonable estimates and assumptions about future revenue , cost projections , cash flows , market multiples and discount rates as source : hologic inc , 10-k , november 19 , 2015

we test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review . while the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment for both goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists , the company elects to perform the quantitative assessment for our annual impairment analysis . the impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or non-amortizable intangible asset to the carrying value . if the carrying value exceeds the fair value , goodwill or a non-amortizable intangible asset is considered impaired . to determine the fair value of goodwill , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model , supported by the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global and local companies within the tobacco industry . at december 31 , 2018 , the carrying value of our goodwill was $ 7.2 billion , which is related to ten reporting units , each of which consists of a group of markets with similar economic characteristics . the estimated fair value of each of our ten reporting units exceeded the carrying value as of december 31 , 2018 . to determine the fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relief-from-royalty method . we concluded that the fair value of our non- amortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value . these discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for forecasting operating cash flows , which are subject to changes in business conditions , such as volumes and prices , costs to produce , discount rates and estimated capital needs . management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated , and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use . since the march 28 , 2008 , spin-off from altria group , inc. , we have not recorded a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or non-amortizable intangible assets . marketing costs - we incur certain costs to support our products through programs that include advertising , marketing , consumer engagement and trade promotions . the costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with u.s . recognition of the cost related to our consumer engagement and trade promotion programs contain uncertainties due to the judgment required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program . for volume-based incentives provided to customers , management continually assesses and estimates , by customer , the likelihood of the customer's achieving the specified targets , and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made . for other trade promotions , management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience . changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position , results of operations or operating cash flows . employee benefit plans - as discussed in item 8 , note 13 . benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements , we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees , including pensions , postretirement health care and postemployment benefits ( primarily severance ) . we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by u.s . these calculations include various actuarial assumptions , such as discount rates , assumed rates of return on plan assets , compensation increases , mortality , turnover rates and health care cost trend rates . we review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so . as permitted by u.s . gaap , any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods . we believe that the assumptions utilized in calculating our obligations under these plans are reasonable based upon our historical experience and advice from our actuaries . weighted-average discount rate assumptions for pension and postretirement plan obligations at december 31 , 2018 and 2017 are as follows: . we anticipate that assumption changes will increase 2019 pre-tax pension and postretirement expense to approximately $ 205 million as compared with approximately $ 160 million in 2018 , excluding amounts related to employee severance and early retirement programs . the anticipated increase is primarily due to higher amortization out of other comprehensive earnings for unrecognized actuarial gains/ losses of $ 14 million , coupled with lower return on assets of $ 16 million , higher interest and service cost of $ 12 million and $ 4 million respectively , partially offset by other movements of $ 1 million . weighted-average expected rate of return and discount rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amount of expense reported for the employee benefit plans . a fifty-basis-point decrease in our discount rate would increase our 2019 pension and postretirement expense by approximately $ 50 million , and a fifty-basis-point increase in our discount rate would decrease our 2019 pension and postretirement .",

    "text": "tissue pulp due to strong market demand , partic- ularly from asia . average sales price realizations improved significantly in 2007 , principally reflecting higher average prices for softwood , hardwood and fluff pulp . operating earnings in 2007 were $ 104 mil- lion compared with $ 48 million in 2006 and $ 37 mil- lion in 2005 . the benefits from higher sales price realizations were partially offset by increased input costs for energy , chemicals and freight . entering the first quarter of 2008 , demand for market pulp remains strong , and average sales price realiza- tions should increase slightly . however , input costs for energy , chemicals and freight are expected to be higher , and increased spending is anticipated for planned mill maintenance outages . industrial packaging demand for industrial packaging products is closely correlated with non-durable industrial goods pro- duction , as well as with demand for processed foods , poultry , meat and agricultural products . in addition to prices and volumes , major factors affecting the profitability of industrial packaging are raw material and energy costs , freight costs , manufacturing effi- ciency and product mix . industrial packaging net sales for 2007 increased 6% ( 6 % ) to $ 5.2 billion compared with $ 4.9 bil- lion in 2006 , and 13% ( 13 % ) compared with $ 4.6 billion in 2005 . operating profits in 2007 were 26% ( 26 % ) higher than in 2006 and more than double 2005 earnings . bene- fits from improved price realizations ( $ 147 million ) , sales volume increases net of increased lack of order downtime ( $ 3 million ) , a more favorable mix ( $ 31 million ) , strong mill and converting operations ( $ 33 million ) and other costs ( $ 47 million ) were partially offset by the effects of higher raw material costs ( $ 76 million ) and higher freight costs ( $ 18 million ) . in addition , a gain of $ 13 million was recognized in 2006 related to a sale of property in spain and costs of $ 52 million were incurred in 2007 related to the conversion of the paper machine at pensacola to production of lightweight linerboard . the segment took 165000 tons of downtime in 2007 which included 16000 tons of market-related downtime compared with 135000 tons of downtime in 2006 of which none was market-related . industrial packaging in millions 2007 2006 2005 . north american industrial packaging net sales for 2007 were $ 3.9 billion , compared with $ 3.7 billion in 2006 and $ 3.6 billion in 2005 . operating profits in 2007 were $ 407 million , up from $ 327 mil- lion in 2006 and $ 170 million in 2005 . containerboard shipments were higher in 2007 compared with 2006 , including production from the paper machine at pensacola that was converted to lightweight linerboard during 2007 . average sales price realizations were significantly higher than in 2006 reflecting price increases announced early in 2006 and in the third quarter of 2007 . margins improved reflecting stronger export demand . manu- facturing performance was strong , although costs associated with planned mill maintenance outages were higher due to timing of outages . raw material costs for wood , energy , chemicals and recycled fiber increased significantly . operating results for 2007 were also unfavorably impacted by $ 52 million of costs associated with the conversion and startup of the pensacola paper machine . converting sales volumes were slightly lower in 2007 compared with 2006 reflecting softer customer box demand . earnings improvement in 2007 bene- fited from the realization of box price increases announced in early 2006 and late 2007 . favorable manufacturing operations and higher sales prices for waste fiber more than offset significantly higher raw material and freight costs . looking ahead to the first quarter of 2008 , sales volumes are expected to increase slightly , and results should benefit from a full-quarter impact of the price increases announced in the third quarter of 2007 . however , additional mill maintenance outages are planned for the first quarter , and freight and input costs are expected to rise , particularly for wood and energy . manufacturing operations should be favorable compared with the fourth quarter . european industrial packaging net sales for 2007 were $ 1.1 billion , up from $ 1.0 billion in 2006 and $ 880 million in 2005 . sales volumes were about flat as early stronger demand in the industrial segment weakened in the second half of the year . operating profits in 2007 were $ 88 million compared with $ 69 million in 2006 and $ 53 million in 2005 . sales margins improved reflecting increased sales prices for boxes . conversion costs were favorable as the result of manufacturing improvement programs . entering the first quarter of 2008 , sales volumes should be strong seasonally across all regions as the winter fruit and vegetable season continues . profit margins , however , are expected to be somewhat lower. .",

first-quarter main- tenance outages . sales volumes for u.s . converted products will be higher due to more shipping days , but expected softer demand should cause the ship- ments per day to decrease . average sales price real- izations are expected to be comparable to fourth- quarter averages . an additional containerboard price increase was announced in january that is expected to be fully realized in the second quarter . costs for wood , energy , starch , adhesives and freight are expected to increase . manufacturing costs will be higher due to costs associated with scheduled main- tenance outages in the containerboard mills . euro- pean container operating results are expected to improve as seasonally higher sales volumes and improved margins more than offset slightly higher manufacturing costs . consumer packaging demand and pricing for consumer packaging prod- ucts correlate closely with consumer spending and general economic activity . in addition to prices and volumes , major factors affecting the profitability of consumer packaging are raw material and energy costs , manufacturing efficiency and product mix . consumer packaging net sales increased 9% ( 9 % ) compared with 2005 and 7% ( 7 % ) compared with 2004 . operating profits rose 8% ( 8 % ) from 2005 , but declined 15% ( 15 % ) from 2004 levels . compared with 2005 , higher sales volumes ( $ 9 million ) , improved average sales price realizations ( $ 33 million ) , reduced lack-of-order downtime ( $ 18 million ) , and favorable mill oper- ations ( $ 25 million ) were partially offset by higher raw material costs ( $ 19 million ) and freight costs ( $ 21 million ) , unfavorable mix ( $ 14 million ) and other costs ( $ 21 million ) . consumer packaging in millions 2006 2005 2004 . coated paperboard net sales of $ 1.5 billion in 2006 were higher than $ 1.3 billion in 2005 and $ 1.1 billion in 2004 . sales volumes increased in 2006 compared with 2005 , particularly in the folding car- ton board segment , reflecting improved demand for coated paperboard products . in 2006 , our coated paperboard mills took 4000 tons of lack-of-order downtime , compared with 82000 tons of lack-of-order downtime in 2005 . average sales price realizations were substantially improved in the cur- rent year , principally for folding carton board and cupstock board . operating profits were 51% ( 51 % ) higher in 2006 than in 2005 , and 7% ( 7 % ) better than in 2004 . the impact of the higher sales prices along with more favorable manufacturing operations due to strong performance at the mills more than offset higher input costs for energy and freight . foodservice net sales declined to $ 396 million in 2006 , compared with $ 437 million in 2005 and $ 480 million in 2004 , due principally to the sale of the jackson , tennessee plant in july 2005 . sales vol- umes were lower in 2006 than in 2005 , although average sales prices were higher due to the realiza- tion of price increases implemented during 2005 . operating profits for 2006 improved over 2005 and 2004 levels largely due to the benefits from higher sales prices . raw material costs for bleached board were higher than in 2005 , but manufacturing costs were more favorable due to increased productivity and reduced waste . shorewood net sales of $ 670 million were down from $ 691 million in 2005 and $ 687 million in 2004 . sales volumes in 2006 were down from 2005 levels due to weak demand in the home entertainment and consumer products markets , although demand was strong in the tobacco segment . average sales prices for the year were lower than in 2005 . operating prof- its were down significantly from both 2005 and 2004 due to the decline in sales , particularly in the higher margin home entertainment markets , higher raw material costs for bleached board and certain inventory adjustment costs . entering 2007 , coated paperboard first-quarter sales volumes are expected to be seasonally stronger than in the fourth quarter 2006 for folding carton board and bristols . average sales price realizations are expected to rise with a price increase announced in january . it is anticipated that manufacturing costs will improve versus an unfavorable fourth quarter . foodservice earnings for the first quarter of 2007 are expected to decline due to seasonally weaker vol- ume . however , sales price realizations will be slightly higher , and the seasonal switch to hot cup contain- ers will have a favorable impact on product mix . shorewood sales volumes for the first quarter of 2007 are expected to seasonally decline , but the earnings impact will be partially offset by pricing improvements and an improved product mix . distribution our distribution business , principally

( 1 ) service concession asset expenditures excluded from proportional free cash flow non-gaap metric . ( 2 ) the proportional adjustment factor , proportional maintenance capital expenditures ( net of reinsurance proceeds ) and proportional non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures are calculated by multiplying the percentage owned by noncontrolling interests for each entity by its corresponding consolidated cash flow metric and are totaled to the resulting figures . for example , parent company a owns 20% ( 20 % ) of subsidiary company b , a consolidated subsidiary . thus , subsidiary company b has an 80% ( 80 % ) noncontrolling interest . assuming a consolidated net cash flow from operating activities of $ 100 from subsidiary b , the proportional adjustment factor for subsidiary b would equal $ 80 ( or $ 100 x 80% ( 80 % ) ) . the company calculates the proportional adjustment factor for each consolidated business in this manner and then sums these amounts to determine the total proportional adjustment factor used in the reconciliation . the proportional adjustment factor may differ from the proportion of income attributable to noncontrolling interests as a result of ( a ) non-cash items which impact income but not cash and ( b ) aes' ownership interest in the subsidiary where such items occur . ( 3 ) includes proportional adjustment amount for service concession asset expenditures of $ 84 million for the year ended december 31 , 2015 . the company adopted service concession accounting effective january 1 , 2015 .

    "text": "middleton's reported cigars shipment volume for 2012 decreased 0.7% ( 0.7 % ) due primarily to changes in trade inventories , partially offset by volume growth as a result of retail share gains . in the cigarette category , marlboro's 2012 retail share performance continued to benefit from the brand-building initiatives supporting marlboro's new architecture . marlboro's retail share for 2012 increased 0.6 share points versus 2011 to 42.6% ( 42.6 % ) . in january 2013 , pm usa expanded distribution of marlboro southern cut nationally . marlboro southern cut is part of the marlboro gold family . pm usa's 2012 retail share increased 0.8 share points versus 2011 , reflecting retail share gains by marlboro and by l&m in discount . these gains were partially offset by share losses on other portfolio brands . in the machine-made large cigars category , black & mild's retail share for 2012 increased 0.5 share points . the brand benefited from new untipped cigarillo varieties that were introduced in 2011 , black & mild seasonal offerings and the 2012 third-quarter introduction of black & mild jazz untipped cigarillos into select geographies . in december 2012 , middleton announced plans to launch nationally black & mild jazz cigars in both plastic tip and wood tip in the first quarter of 2013 . the following discussion compares smokeable products segment results for the year ended december 31 , 2011 with the year ended december 31 , 2010 . net revenues , which include excise taxes billed to customers , decreased $ 221 million ( 1.0% ( 1.0 % ) ) due to lower shipment volume ( $ 1051 million ) , partially offset by higher net pricing ( $ 830 million ) , which includes higher promotional investments . operating companies income increased $ 119 million ( 2.1% ( 2.1 % ) ) , due primarily to higher net pricing ( $ 831 million ) , which includes higher promotional investments , marketing , administration , and research savings reflecting cost reduction initiatives ( $ 198 million ) and 2010 implementation costs related to the closure of the cabarrus , north carolina manufacturing facility ( $ 75 million ) , partially offset by lower volume ( $ 527 million ) , higher asset impairment and exit costs due primarily to the 2011 cost reduction program ( $ 158 million ) , higher per unit settlement charges ( $ 120 million ) , higher charges related to tobacco and health judgments ( $ 87 million ) and higher fda user fees ( $ 73 million ) . for 2011 , total smokeable products shipment volume decreased 4.0% ( 4.0 % ) versus 2010 . pm usa's reported domestic cigarettes shipment volume declined 4.0% ( 4.0 % ) versus 2010 due primarily to retail share losses and one less shipping day , partially offset by changes in trade inventories . after adjusting for changes in trade inventories and one less shipping day , pm usa's 2011 domestic cigarette shipment volume was estimated to be down approximately 4% ( 4 % ) versus 2010 . pm usa believes that total cigarette category volume for 2011 decreased approximately 3.5% ( 3.5 % ) versus 2010 , when adjusted primarily for changes in trade inventories and one less shipping day . pm usa's total premium brands ( marlboro and other premium brands ) shipment volume decreased 4.3% ( 4.3 % ) . marlboro's shipment volume decreased 3.8% ( 3.8 % ) versus 2010 . in the discount brands , pm usa's shipment volume decreased 0.9% ( 0.9 % ) . pm usa's shipments of premium cigarettes accounted for 93.7% ( 93.7 % ) of its reported domestic cigarettes shipment volume for 2011 , down from 93.9% ( 93.9 % ) in 2010 . middleton's 2011 reported cigars shipment volume was unchanged versus 2010 . for 2011 , pm usa's retail share of the cigarette category declined 0.8 share points to 49.0% ( 49.0 % ) due primarily to retail share losses on marlboro . marlboro's 2011 retail share decreased 0.6 share points . in 2010 , marlboro delivered record full-year retail share results that were achieved at lower margin levels . middleton retained a leading share of the tipped cigarillo segment of the machine-made large cigars category , with a retail share of approximately 84% ( 84 % ) in 2011 . for 2011 , middleton's retail share of the cigar category increased 0.3 share points to 29.7% ( 29.7 % ) versus 2010 . black & mild's 2011 retail share increased 0.5 share points , as the brand benefited from new product introductions . during the fourth quarter of 2011 , middleton broadened its untipped cigarillo portfolio with new aroma wrap 2122 foil pouch packaging that accompanied the national introduction of black & mild wine . this new fourth- quarter packaging roll-out also included black & mild sweets and classic varieties . during the second quarter of 2011 , middleton entered into a contract manufacturing arrangement to source the production of a portion of its cigars overseas . middleton entered into this arrangement to access additional production capacity in an uncertain competitive environment and an excise tax environment that potentially benefits imported large cigars over those manufactured domestically . smokeless products segment the smokeless products segment's operating companies income grew during 2012 driven by higher pricing , copenhagen and skoal's combined volume and retail share performance and effective cost management . the following table summarizes smokeless products segment shipment volume performance : shipment volume for the years ended december 31 . volume includes cans and packs sold , as well as promotional units , but excludes

were outstanding as of december 31 , 2008 and december 31 , 2007 , respectively . changes in fair value of funded and unfunded credit products are classified in principal transactions in the company 2019s consolidated statement of income . related interest revenue is measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as interest revenue on trading account assets or loans depending on their balance sheet classifications . the changes in fair value for the years ended december 31 , 2008 and 2007 due to instrument-specific credit risk totaled to a loss of $ 38 million and $ 188 million , respectively . certain investments in private equity and real estate ventures and certain equity method investments citigroup invests in private equity and real estate ventures for the purpose of earning investment returns and for capital appreciation . the company has elected the fair-value option for certain of these ventures , because such investments are considered similar to many private equity or hedge fund activities in our investment companies , which are reported at fair value . the fair-value option brings consistency in the accounting and evaluation of certain of these investments . as required by sfas 159 , all investments ( debt and equity ) in such private equity and real estate entities are accounted for at fair value . these investments are classified as investments on citigroup 2019s consolidated balance sheet . citigroup also holds various non-strategic investments in leveraged buyout funds and other hedge funds that previously were required to be accounted for under the equity method . the company elected fair-value accounting to reduce operational and accounting complexity . since the funds account for all of their underlying assets at fair value , the impact of applying the equity method to citigroup 2019s investment in these funds was equivalent to fair-value accounting . thus , this fair-value election had no impact on opening retained earnings . these investments are classified as other assets on citigroup 2019s consolidated balance sheet . changes in the fair values of these investments are classified in other revenue in the company 2019s consolidated statement of income . certain structured liabilities the company has elected the fair-value option for certain structured liabilities whose performance is linked to structured interest rates , inflation or currency risks ( 201cstructured liabilities 201d ) . the company elected the fair- value option , because these exposures are considered to be trading-related positions and , therefore , are managed on a fair-value basis . these positions will continue to be classified as debt , deposits or derivatives ( trading account liabilities ) on the company 2019s consolidated balance sheet according to their legal form . for those structured liabilities classified as long-term debt for which the fair-value option has been elected , the aggregate unpaid principal balance exceeds the aggregate fair value of such instruments by $ 277 million as of december 31 , 2008 and $ 7 million as of december 31 , 2007 . the change in fair value for these structured liabilities is reported in principal transactions in the company 2019s consolidated statement of income . related interest expense is measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as such in the consolidated income statement . certain non-structured liabilities the company has elected the fair-value option for certain non-structured liabilities with fixed and floating

in connection with sales of businesses , property , equipment , forestlands and other assets , interna- tional paper commonly makes representations and warranties relating to such businesses or assets , and may agree to indemnify buyers with respect to tax and environmental liabilities , breaches of representations and warranties , and other matters . where liabilities for such matters are determined to be probable and subject to reasonable estimation , accrued liabilities are recorded at the time of sale as a cost of the transaction . environmental proceedings international paper has been named as a potentially responsible party in environmental remediation actions under various federal and state laws , includ- ing the comprehensive environmental response , compensation and liability act ( cercla ) . many of these proceedings involve the cleanup of hazardous substances at large commercial landfills that received waste from many different sources . while joint and several liability is authorized under cercla and equivalent state laws , as a practical matter , liability for cercla cleanups is typically allocated among the many potential responsible parties . remedial costs are recorded in the consolidated financial statements when they become probable and reasonably estimable . international paper has estimated the probable liability associated with these matters to be approximately $ 92 million in the aggregate at december 31 , 2012 . one of the matters referenced above is a closed wood treating facility located in cass lake , minneso- ta . during 2009 , in connection with an environmental site remediation action under cercla , international paper submitted to the epa a site remediation feasi- bility study . in june 2011 , the epa selected and published a proposed soil remedy at the site with an estimated cost of $ 46 million . the overall remediation reserve for the site is currently $ 48 mil- lion to address this selection of an alternative for the soil remediation component of the overall site remedy . in october 2011 , the epa released a public statement indicating that the final soil remedy deci- sion would be delayed . in the unlikely event that the epa changes its proposed soil remedy and approves instead a more expensive clean-up alternative , the remediation costs could be material , and sig- nificantly higher than amounts currently recorded . in october 2012 , the natural resource trustees for this site provided notice to international paper and other potentially responsible parties of their intent to per- form a natural resource damage assessment . it is premature to predict the outcome of the assessment or to estimate a loss or range of loss , if any , which may be incurred . in addition to the above matters , other remediation costs typically associated with the cleanup of hazardous substances at the company 2019s current , closed or formerly-owned facilities , and recorded as liabilities in the balance sheet , totaled approximately $ 46 million at december 31 , 2012 . other than as described above , completion of required remedial actions is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements . the company is a potentially responsible party with respect to the allied paper , inc./portage creek/ kalamazoo river superfund site ( kalamazoo river superfund site ) in michigan . the epa asserts that the site is contaminated primarily by pcbs as a result of discharges from various paper mills located along the river , including a paper mill formerly owned by st .

and georgia pacific llc in a contribution and cost recovery action for alleged pollution at the kalamazoo river super- fund site . the suit seeks contribution under cercla for $ 79 million in costs

( 2 ) the proportional adjustment factor , proportional maintenance capital expenditures ( net of reinsurance proceeds ) and proportional non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures are calculated by multiplying the percentage owned by noncontrolling interests for each entity by its corresponding consolidated cash flow metric and are totaled to the resulting figures . for example , parent company a owns 20% ( 20 % ) of subsidiary company b , a consolidated subsidiary . thus , subsidiary company b has an 80% ( 80 % ) noncontrolling interest . assuming a consolidated net cash flow from operating activities of $ 100 from subsidiary b , the proportional adjustment factor for subsidiary b would equal $ 80 ( or $ 100 x 80% ( 80 % ) ) . the company calculates the proportional adjustment factor for each consolidated business in this manner and then sums these amounts to determine the total proportional adjustment factor used in the reconciliation . the proportional adjustment factor may differ from the proportion of income attributable to noncontrolling interests as a result of ( a ) non-cash items which impact income but not cash and ( b ) aes' ownership interest in the subsidiary where such items occur .

for the periods indicated. . we recorded net pre-tax catastrophe losses of $ 366 million in 2010 compared with net pre-tax catastrophe losses of $ 137 million and $ 567 million in 2009 and 2008 , respectively . the catastrophe losses for 2010 were primarily related to weather- related events in the u.s. , earthquakes in chile , mexico , and new zealand , and storms in australia and europe . the catastrophe losses for 2009 were primarily related to an earthquake in asia , floods in europe , several weather-related events in the u.s. , and a european windstorm . for 2008 , the catastrophe losses were primarily related to hurricanes gustav and ike . prior period development arises from changes to loss estimates recognized in the current year that relate to loss reserves first reported in previous calendar years and excludes the effect of losses from the development of earned premium from pre- vious accident years . we experienced $ 503 million of net favorable prior period development in our p&c segments in 2010 . this compares with net favorable prior period development in our p&c segments of $ 576 million and $ 814 million in 2009 and 2008 , respectively . refer to 201cprior period development 201d for more information . the adjusted loss and loss expense ratio declined in 2010 , compared with 2009 , primarily due to the impact of the crop settlements , non-recurring premium adjustment and the reduction in assumed loss portfolio business , which is written at higher loss ratios than other types of business . our policy acquisition costs include commissions , premium taxes , underwriting , and other costs that vary with , and are primarily related to , the production of premium . administrative expenses include all other operating costs . our policy acquis- ition cost ratio increased in 2010 , compared with 2009 . the increase was primarily related to the impact of crop settlements , which generated higher profit-share commissions and a lower adjustment to net premiums earned , as well as the impact of reinstatement premiums expensed in connection with catastrophe activity and changes in business mix . our administrative expense ratio increased in 2010 , primarily due to the impact of the crop settlements , reinstatement premiums expensed , and increased costs in our international operations . although the crop settlements generate minimal administrative expenses , they resulted in lower adjustment to net premiums earned in 2010 , compared with 2009 . administrative expenses in 2010 , were partially offset by higher net results generated by our third party claims administration business , esis , the results of which are included within our administrative expenses . esis generated $ 85 million in net results in 2010 , compared with $ 26 million in 2009 . the increase is primarily from non-recurring sources . our policy acquisition cost ratio was stable in 2009 , compared with 2008 , as increases in our combined insurance operations were offset by more favorable final crop year settlement of profit share commissions . administrative expenses increased in 2009 , primarily due to the inclusion of administrative expenses related to combined insurance for the full year and costs associated with new product expansion in our domestic retail operation and in our personal lines business . our effective income tax rate , which we calculate as income tax expense divided by income before income tax , is depend- ent upon the mix of earnings from different jurisdictions with various tax rates . a change in the geographic mix of earnings would change the effective income tax rate . our effective income tax rate was 15 percent in 2010 , compared with 17 percent and 24 percent in 2009 and 2008 , respectively . the decrease in our effective income tax rate in 2010 , was primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings to lower tax-paying jurisdictions , a decrease in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits which was the result of a settlement with the u.s . internal revenue service appeals division regarding federal tax returns for the years 2002-2004 , and the recognition of a non-taxable gain related to the acquisition of rain and hail . the 2009 year included a reduction of a deferred tax valuation allowance related to investments . for 2008 , our effective income tax rate was adversely impacted by a change in mix of earnings due to the impact of catastrophe losses in lower tax-paying jurisdictions . prior period development the favorable prior period development , inclusive of the life segment , of $ 512 million during 2010 was the net result of sev- eral underlying favorable and adverse movements . with respect to ace 2019s crop business , ace regularly receives reports from its managing general agent ( mga ) relating to the previous crop year ( s ) in subsequent calendar quarters and this typically results .",

primarily was attributable to an improvement in our operating working capital balances of $ 570 million as discussed below , and $ 187 million related to lower net income tax payments , as compared to 2009 . partially offsetting these improvements was a net reduction in cash from operations of $ 350 million related to our defined benefit pension plan . this reduction was the result of increased contributions to the pension trust of $ 758 million as compared to 2009 , partially offset by an increase in the cas costs recovered on our contracts . operating working capital accounts consists of receivables , inventories , accounts payable , and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred . the improvement in cash provided by operating working capital was due to a decline in 2010 accounts receivable balances compared to 2009 , and an increase in 2010 customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred balances compared to 2009 . these improvements partially were offset by a decline in accounts payable balances in 2010 compared to 2009 . the decline in accounts receivable primarily was due to higher collections on various programs at electronic systems , is&gs , and space systems business areas . the increase in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred primarily was attributable to an increase on government and commercial satellite programs at space systems and air mobility programs at aeronautics , partially offset by a decrease on various programs at electronic systems . the decrease in accounts payable was attributable to the timing of accounts payable activities across all segments . net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $ 1248 million to $ 3173 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 . the decline primarily was attributable to an increase in our contributions to the defined benefit pension plan of $ 1373 million as compared to 2008 and an increase in our operating working capital accounts of $ 147 million . partially offsetting these items was the impact of lower net income tax payments in 2009 as compared to 2008 in the amount of $ 319 million . the decline in cash provided by operating working capital primarily was due to growth of receivables on various programs in the ms2 and gt&l lines of business at electronic systems and an increase in inventories on combat aircraft programs at aeronautics , which partially were offset by increases in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred on government satellite programs at space systems and the timing of accounts payable activities .

to $ 820 million in 2010 , $ 852 million in 2009 , and $ 926 million in 2008 . we expect that our operating cash flows will continue to be sufficient to fund our annual capital expenditures over the

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists , delivery of product has occurred , the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured . for our company , this means that revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss is transferred to our customers . title transfers to our customers upon shipment or upon receipt at the customer's location as determined by the sales terms for each transaction . the company estimates the cost of sales returns based on historical experience , and these estimates are normally immaterial . 2022 goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets valuation - we test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review . we perform our annual impairment analysis in the first quarter of each year . while the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment for both goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists , the company elects to perform the quantitative assessment for our annual impairment analysis . the impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or non-amortizable intangible asset to the carrying value . if the carrying value exceeds the fair value , goodwill or a non-amortizable intangible asset is considered impaired . to determine the fair value of goodwill , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model , supported by the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global and local companies within the tobacco industry . at december 31 , 2015 , the carrying value of our goodwill was $ 7.4 billion , which is related to ten reporting units , each of which is comprised of a group of markets with similar economic characteristics . the estimated fair value of our ten reporting units exceeded the carrying value as of december 31 , 2015 . to determine the fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relief-from-royalty method . we concluded that the fair value of our non-amortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value , and any reasonable movement in the assumptions would not result in an impairment . these discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for forecasting operating cash flows , which are subject to changes in business conditions , such as volumes and prices , costs to produce , discount rates and estimated capital needs . management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated , and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use . since the march 28 , 2008 , spin-off from altria , we have not recorded a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or non-amortizable intangible assets . 2022 marketing and advertising costs - we incur certain costs to support our products through programs which include advertising , marketing , consumer engagement and trade promotions . the costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with u.s . recognition of the cost related to our consumer engagement and trade promotion programs contain uncertainties due to the judgment required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program . for volume-based incentives provided to customers , management continually assesses and estimates , by customer , the likelihood of the customer achieving the specified targets and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made . for other trade promotions , management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience . changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position , results of operations or operating cash flows . we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate our marketing programs during the past three years . 2022 employee benefit plans - as discussed in item 8 , note 13 . benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements , we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees , including pensions , postretirement health care and postemployment benefits ( primarily severance ) . we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by u.s . these calculations include various actuarial assumptions , such as discount rates , assumed rates of return on plan assets , compensation increases , mortality , turnover rates and health care cost trend rates . we review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so . as permitted by u.s . gaap , any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods . we believe that the assumptions utilized in calculating our obligations under these plans are reasonable based upon our historical experience and advice from our actuaries . weighted-average discount rate assumptions for pensions and postretirement plans are as follows: . we anticipate that assumption changes , coupled with decreased amortization of deferred losses , will decrease 2016 pre-tax u.s . pension and postretirement expense to approximately $ 209 million as compared with approximately $ 240 million in 2015 , excluding .",

    "text": "( a ) effective in 2016 , the company began to measure the service cost and interest cost components of pension expense by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows , as we believe this provides a better measurement of these costs . the company has accounted for this as a change in accounting estimate and , accordingly has accounted for it on a prospective basis . this change does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligation . 2015 pension expense , excluding special items , decreased from the prior year due to the adoption of the spot rate approach which reduced service cost and interest cost , the impact from expected return on assets and demographic gains , partially offset by the impact of the adoption of new mortality tables for our major plans . special items of $ 7.3 included pension settlement losses of $ 6.4 , special termination benefits of $ 2.0 , and curtailment gains of $ 1.1 . these resulted primarily from our recent business restructuring and cost reduction actions . 2014 the decrease in pension expense , excluding special items , was due to the impact from expected return on assets , a 40 bp reduction in the weighted average compensation increase assumption , and lower service cost and interest cost . the decrease was partially offset by the impact of higher amortization of actuarial losses , which resulted primarily from a 60 bp decrease in weighted average discount rate . special items of $ 35.2 included pension settlement losses of $ 21.2 , special termination benefits of $ 8.7 , and curtailment losses of $ 5.3 . these resulted primarily from our recent business restructuring and cost reduction actions . 2017 outlook in 2017 , pension expense , excluding special items , is estimated to be approximately $ 70 to $ 75 , an increase of $ 10 to $ 15 from 2016 , resulting primarily from a decrease in discount rates , offset by favorable asset experience , effects of the versum spin-off and the adoption of new mortality tables . pension settlement losses of $ 10 to $ 15 are expected , dependent on the timing of retirements . in 2017 , we expect pension expense to include approximately $ 164 for amortization of actuarial losses compared to $ 121 in 2016 . net actuarial losses of $ 484 were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in 2016 , primarily attributable to lower discount rates and improved mortality projections . actuarial gains/losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses . future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets different from expected returns would impact the actuarial gains/losses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2017 . during the first quarter of 2017 , the company expects to record a curtailment loss estimated to be $ 5 to $ 10 related to employees transferring to versum . the loss will be reflected in the results from discontinued operations on the consolidated income statements . we continue to evaluate opportunities to manage the liabilities associated with our pension plans . pension funding pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans , which are primarily non-qualified plans . with respect to funded plans , our funding policy is that contributions , combined with appreciation and earnings , will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses . in addition , we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions . with the assistance of third party actuaries , we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan , which help guide the level of contributions . during 2016 and 2015 , our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were $ 79.3 and $ 137.5 , respectively . for 2017 , cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be $ 65 to $ 85 . the estimate is based on expected contributions to certain international plans and anticipated benefit payments for unfunded plans , which .",

    "text": "inventory on hand , as well as our future purchase commitments with our suppliers , considering multiple factors , including demand forecasts , product life cycle , current sales levels , pricing strategy and cost trends . if our review indicates that inventories of raw materials , components or finished products have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or that inventory cost exceeds net realizable value , we may be required to make adjustments that will impact the results of operations . goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets valuation - we test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review . while the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment for both goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists , the company elects to perform the quantitative assessment for our annual impairment analysis . the impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or non-amortizable intangible asset to the carrying value . if the carrying value exceeds the fair value , goodwill or a non-amortizable intangible asset is considered impaired . to determine the fair value of goodwill , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model , supported by the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global and local companies within the tobacco industry . at december 31 , 2018 , the carrying value of our goodwill was $ 7.2 billion , which is related to ten reporting units , each of which consists of a group of markets with similar economic characteristics . the estimated fair value of each of our ten reporting units exceeded the carrying value as of december 31 , 2018 . to determine the fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relief-from-royalty method . we concluded that the fair value of our non- amortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value . these discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for forecasting operating cash flows , which are subject to changes in business conditions , such as volumes and prices , costs to produce , discount rates and estimated capital needs . management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated , and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use . since the march 28 , 2008 , spin-off from altria group , inc. , we have not recorded a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or non-amortizable intangible assets . marketing costs - we incur certain costs to support our products through programs that include advertising , marketing , consumer engagement and trade promotions . the costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with u.s . recognition of the cost related to our consumer engagement and trade promotion programs contain uncertainties due to the judgment required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program . for volume-based incentives provided to customers , management continually assesses and estimates , by customer , the likelihood of the customer's achieving the specified targets , and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made . for other trade promotions , management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience . changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position , results of operations or operating cash flows . employee benefit plans - as discussed in item 8 , note 13 . benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements , we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees , including pensions , postretirement health care and postemployment benefits ( primarily severance ) . we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by u.s . these calculations include various actuarial assumptions , such as discount rates , assumed rates of return on plan assets , compensation increases , mortality , turnover rates and health care cost trend rates . we review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so . as permitted by u.s . gaap , any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods . we believe that the assumptions utilized in calculating our obligations under these plans are reasonable based upon our historical experience and advice from our actuaries . weighted-average discount rate assumptions for pension and postretirement plan obligations at december 31 , 2018 and 2017 are as follows: . we anticipate that assumption changes will increase 2019 pre-tax pension and postretirement expense to approximately $ 205 million as compared with approximately $ 160 million in 2018 , excluding amounts related to employee severance and early retirement programs . the anticipated increase is primarily due to higher amortization out of other comprehensive earnings for unrecognized actuarial gains/ losses of $ 14 million , coupled with lower return on assets of $ 16 million , higher interest and service cost of $ 12 million and $ 4 million respectively , partially offset by other movements of $ 1 million . weighted-average expected rate of return and discount rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amount of expense reported for the employee benefit plans . a fifty-basis-point decrease in our discount rate would increase our 2019 pension and postretirement expense by approximately $ 50 million , and a fifty-basis-point increase in our discount rate would decrease our 2019 pension and postretirement .",

    "text": "at december 31 , 2015 and 2014 , we had a modest working capital surplus . this reflects a strong cash position that provides enhanced liquidity in an uncertain economic environment . in addition , we believe we have adequate access to capital markets to meet any foreseeable cash requirements , and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities . operating activities cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower net income and changes in working capital , partially offset by the timing of tax payments . federal tax law provided for 100% ( 100 % ) bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2011 and 50% ( 50 % ) bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2012-2013 . as a result , the company deferred a substantial portion of its 2011-2013 income tax expense , contributing to the positive operating cash flow in those years . congress extended 50% ( 50 % ) bonus depreciation for 2014 , but this extension occurred in december , and the related benefit was realized in 2015 , rather than 2014 . similarly , in december of 2015 , congress extended bonus depreciation through 2019 , which delayed the benefit of 2015 bonus depreciation into 2016 . bonus depreciation will be at a rate of 50% ( 50 % ) for 2015 , 2016 and 2017 , 40% ( 40 % ) for 2018 and 30% ( 30 % ) for 2019 . higher net income in 2014 increased cash provided by operating activities compared to 2013 , despite higher income tax payments . 2014 income tax payments were higher than 2013 primarily due to higher income , but also because we paid taxes previously deferred by bonus depreciation . investing activities higher capital investments in locomotives and freight cars , including $ 327 million in early lease buyouts , which we exercised due to favorable economic terms and market conditions , drove the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014 . higher capital investments , including the early buyout of the long-term operating lease of our headquarters building for approximately $ 261 million , drove the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2014 compared to 2013 . significant investments also were made for new locomotives , freight cars and containers , and capacity and commercial facility projects . capital investments in 2014 also included $ 99 million for the early buyout of locomotives and freight cars under long-term operating leases , which we exercised due to favorable economic terms and market conditions. .",

actuarial assumptions . investment performance has the most impact on contribution requirements and will drive the amount of permitted contributions in future years . also , current law , including the provisions of the pension protection act of 2006 , sets limits as to both minimum and maximum contributions to the plan . we do not expect to be required by law to make any contributions to the

, and service certain multi-family commercial mortgage loans which are sold to fnma under fnma 2019s delegated underwriting and servicing ( dus ) program . we participated in a similar program with the fhlmc . under these programs , we generally assume up to a one-third pari passu risk of loss on unpaid principal balances through a loss share arrangement . at december 31 , 2011 and december 31 , 2010 , the unpaid principal balance outstanding of loans sold as a participant in these programs was $ 13.0 billion and $ 13.2 billion , respectively . the potential maximum exposure under the loss

totaled $ 47 million and $ 54 million as of december 31 , 2011 and december 31 , 2010 , respectively , and is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet . if payment is required under these programs , we would not have a contractual interest in the collateral underlying the mortgage loans on which losses occurred , although the value of the collateral is taken into account in determining our share of such losses . our exposure and activity associated with these recourse obligations are reported in the corporate & institutional banking segment . residential mortgage loan

investors . these loan repurchase obligations primarily relate to situations where pnc is alleged to have breached certain origination covenants and representations and warranties made to purchasers of the loans in the respective purchase and sale agreements . residential mortgage loans covered by these loan repurchase obligations include first and second-lien mortgage loans we have sold through agency securitizations , non-agency securitizations , and whole-loan sale transactions . as discussed in note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report , agency securitizations consist of mortgage loans sale transactions with fnma , fhlmc , and the government national mortgage association ( gnma ) program , while non-agency securitizations and whole-loan sale transactions consist of mortgage loans sale transactions with private investors . our historical exposure and activity associated with agency securitization repurchase obligations has primarily been related to transactions with fnma and fhlmc , as indemnification and repurchase losses associated with federal housing agency ( fha ) and department of veterans affairs ( va ) -insured and uninsured loans pooled in gnma securitizations historically have been minimal . repurchase obligation activity associated with residential mortgages is reported in the residential mortgage banking segment . pnc

our acquisition . pnc is no longer engaged in the brokered home equity lending business , and our exposure under these loan repurchase obligations is limited to repurchases of the whole-loans sold in

first-quarter main- tenance outages . sales volumes for u.s . converted products will be higher due to more shipping days , but expected softer demand should cause the ship- ments per day to decrease . average sales price real- izations are expected to be comparable to fourth- quarter averages . an additional containerboard price increase was announced in january that is expected to be fully realized in the second quarter . costs for wood , energy , starch , adhesives and freight are expected to increase . manufacturing costs will be higher due to costs associated with scheduled main- tenance outages in the containerboard mills . euro- pean container operating results are expected to improve as seasonally higher sales volumes and improved margins more than offset slightly higher manufacturing costs . consumer packaging demand and pricing for consumer packaging prod- ucts correlate closely with consumer spending and general economic activity . in addition to prices and volumes , major factors affecting the profitability of consumer packaging are raw material and energy costs , manufacturing efficiency and product mix . consumer packaging net sales increased 9% ( 9 % ) compared with 2005 and 7% ( 7 % ) compared with 2004 . operating profits rose 8% ( 8 % ) from 2005 , but declined 15% ( 15 % ) from 2004 levels . compared with 2005 , higher sales volumes ( $ 9 million ) , improved average sales price realizations ( $ 33 million ) , reduced lack-of-order downtime ( $ 18 million ) , and favorable mill oper- ations ( $ 25 million ) were partially offset by

coated paperboard net sales of $ 1.5 billion in 2006 were higher than $ 1.3 billion in 2005 and $ 1.1 billion in 2004 . sales volumes increased in 2006 compared with 2005 , particularly in the folding car- ton board segment , reflecting improved demand for coated paperboard products . in 2006 , our coated paperboard mills took 4000 tons of lack-of-order downtime , compared with 82000 tons of lack-of-order downtime in 2005 . average sales price realizations were substantially improved in the cur- rent year , principally for folding carton board and cupstock board . operating profits were 51% ( 51 % ) higher in 2006 than in 2005 , and 7% ( 7 % ) better than in 2004 . the impact of the higher sales prices along with more favorable manufacturing operations due to strong performance at the mills more than offset higher input costs for energy and freight . foodservice net sales declined to $ 396 million in 2006 , compared with $ 437 million in 2005 and $ 480 million in 2004 , due principally to the sale of the jackson , tennessee plant in july 2005 . sales vol- umes were lower in 2006 than in 2005 , although average sales prices were higher due to the realiza- tion of price increases implemented during 2005 . operating profits for 2006 improved over 2005 and 2004 levels largely due to the benefits from higher sales prices . raw material costs for bleached board were higher than in 2005 , but manufacturing costs were more favorable due to increased productivity and reduced waste . shorewood net sales of $ 670 million were down from $ 691 million in 2005 and $ 687 million in 2004 . sales volumes in 2006 were down from 2005 levels due to weak demand in the home entertainment and consumer products markets , although demand was strong in the tobacco segment . average sales prices for the year were lower than in 2005 . operating prof- its were down significantly from both 2005 and 2004 due to the decline in sales , particularly in the higher margin home entertainment markets , higher raw material costs for bleached board and certain inventory adjustment costs . entering 2007 , coated paperboard first-quarter sales volumes are expected to be seasonally stronger than in the fourth quarter 2006 for folding carton board and bristols . average sales price realizations are expected to rise with a price increase announced in january . it is anticipated that manufacturing costs will improve versus an unfavorable fourth quarter . foodservice earnings for the first quarter of 2007 are expected to decline due to seasonally weaker vol- ume . however , sales price realizations will be slightly higher , and the seasonal switch to hot cup contain- ers will have a favorable impact on product mix . shorewood sales volumes for the first quarter of 2007 are expected to seasonally decline , but the earnings impact will be partially offset by pricing improvements and an improved product mix . distribution our distribution business , principally
