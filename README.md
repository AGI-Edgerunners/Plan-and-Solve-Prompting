## :robot: Run Plan-and-Solve-Prompting
Set an api-key of OpenAI API in the file ```apikeys.json```
```shell
python main.py --prompt_id 201 \
--dataset SVAMP \
--engine text-davinci-003 \
--learning_type zero_shot
```

## :robot: Run Plan-and-Solve-Prompting with threads
Set 8 different api-keys of OpenAI API in the file ```apikeys.json```
```shell
python main_threads.py --prompt_id 201 \
--dataset SVAMP \
--engine text-davinci-003 \
--learning_type zero_shot
```
