# Plan-and-Solve-Prompting
Improving Zero-Shot Chain-of-Though Reasoning in Large Language Models

## run experiment
Set an api-key of OpenAI API in the file ```apikeys.json```
```shell
python main.py --prompt_id 324 \
--dataset SVAMP \
--engine text-davinci-003 \
--learning_type zero_shot
```

## run experiment with threads
Set 8 different api-keys of OpenAI API in the file ```apikeys.json```
```shell
python main_threads.py --prompt_id 324 \
--dataset SVAMP \
--engine text-davinci-003 \
--learning_type zero_shot
```

<td>Let's first understand the problem and devise a complete plan. Then, let\'s carry out the plan and reason problem step by step. Every step answer the subquestion, \"does the person flip and what is the coin's current state?\". According to the coin's last state, give the final answer (pay attention to every flip and the coinâ€™s turning state).</td>
