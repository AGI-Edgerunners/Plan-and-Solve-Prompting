The number of restaurants is between 1000 and 10000. The type of place can be a big city, town, small town, or Canada.\n\nThe plan is to first determine the type of place that has between 1000 and 10000 restaurants. Then, we can determine the answer.\n\nTo determine the type of place that has between 1000 and 10000 restaurants, we can look at population data for different types of places. According to the US Census Bureau, a big city has a population of 250,000 or more, a town has a population of 2,500 to 250,000, and a small town has a population of 2,500 or less.\n\nBased on this data, we can conclude that a big city is the best option for finding between 1000 and 10000 restaurants.
